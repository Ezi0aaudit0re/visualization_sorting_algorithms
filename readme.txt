THis project is used to visualize various sorting algorithms using bar charts

THe sorting algorithms covered are:-

1.) Insertion sort [0]
2.) Merget Sort [1]
3.) Quick Sort [2]
4.) Max Heap Sort[3]


We consider three cases
1.) Average case [0]
2.) Worst case [1]
3.) Best Case [2]


To run the program we run main.py

We can specify the algorithm we want to run including the case we want to run EG

python main.py 0 0 # this would run insertion sort average case
args[1] = program nanme
args[2] = sorting algorithm
args[3] = case eg worst, best, average
